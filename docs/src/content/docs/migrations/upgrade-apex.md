You don't depend on any changes to this project to upgrade APEX. As soon as an update is available, you can follow these steps to upgrade APEX in your local environment.

## Versions >= 26.2: use the upgrade script

Starting with version 26.2, this project ships a `scripts/upgrade-apex.sh` script that automates downloading the latest APEX, running the installer, copying the images, and reapplying the `INTERNAL` workspace settings (extended session timeout, ACLs, etc.).

```sh
./scripts/upgrade-apex.sh
```

## Versions < 26.2: manual upgrade

### Download and unzip latest APEX version

```sh
# Using curl (pre-installed on macOS):
curl -fLO https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/apex/apex-latest.zip

# Or using wget:
wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/apex/apex-latest.zip

unzip apex-latest.zip
rm apex-latest.zip
rm -rf ./META-INF || true
```

### Perform the upgrade

```sh
cd apex
sql -name local-26ai-sys @apexins.sql TBS_APEX TBS_APEX TEMP /i/
exit;
```

(If you are still on 23ai use `SYSAUX` instead)

```sh
cd apex
sql -name local-23ai-sys @apexins.sql SYSAUX SYSAUX TEMP /i/
# (the connection is named local-23ai-sys on old 23ai installs)
exit;
```

### Update the images

```sh
cd ..
rm -rf ./apex-images || true
cp -r ./apex/images ./apex-images
```

If you get a popup error saying your files are outdated, you need to clear your browser cache.
