# desc: Give every datafile a size ceiling so one file cannot fill the 12GB limit

set -e

# The Free edition allows 12 GB of datafiles per PDB. Go over it and the PDB will
# not open again in ANY mode: ORA-12954 is raised inside the open path (ktslnfy_pdb)
# BEFORE the container opens, so "open read only" and "open upgrade" fail
# identically, and no statement issued inside the PDB can reduce its size. The
# only way back in is manual surgery with the CDB in MOUNT state.
#
# The Oracle image ships undo, SYSTEM, SYSAUX and USERS with no maxsize, and
# earlier versions of this project created audit_trail and every per-schema
# tablespace the same way. On one real install the undo datafile autoextended to
# 3810 MB unobserved and crossed the limit by itself.
#
# This script gives each datafile a ceiling. A ceiling is not a reservation: the
# ceilings deliberately add up to more than 12 GB, and they do NOT keep the total
# under the limit. What they guarantee is that no single file can silently absorb
# all the remaining headroom. A runaway then hits ORA-01653 (or ORA-30036 for
# undo) in one session, the database stays open, and every other schema keeps
# working. Keeping the total down is the job of `used-space` and `shrink-space`.
#
# New installs get these ceilings at creation time from after-first-db-start.sh
# and create-user.sh. This script exists for installs created before that, which
# never re-run after-first-db-start.sh (install.sh skips it once APEX is present).

Usage: scripts/cap-tablespaces.sh [options]

  --check      Report the datafiles that have no ceiling. Read-only. The default.
  --apply      Apply the ceilings.
  --summary    Read-only, machine-readable "key=value" lines only.
  -y, --yes    Do not ask for confirmation before it applies the ceilings.
  -h, --help   This text.

Ceilings, in MB:

  UNDOTBS*      2048    AUDIT_TRAIL   1024    USERS      1024
  TBS_APEX      3072    TBS_*         2048    other      2048
  SYSTEM        never   SYSAUX        never

SYSTEM and SYSAUX are never capped. An ORA-01653 in the middle of a dictionary
operation is a worse failure than the disk it saves, and a full SYSAUX breaks the
scheduler and the AWR jobs in ways that are hard to read. Both grow slowly.

A file that is already larger than its target ceiling gets a ceiling at its
current size. Run `shrink-space` first, then run this script again to bring the
ceiling down to the target.

A ceiling that is already at or below the target is never raised, so a tighter
limit that you set by hand stays.

This reports the PDB only. The 12 GB limit that stops a PDB from opening is
measured per PDB, so that is the scope that matters.

# Every mode below reads this one inline view, so the report and the change can
# never disagree about what needs a ceiling.
#
# "Uncapped" is NOT `maxbytes = 0`. Measured on 23.26.2: maxbytes = 0 means
# autoextensible = 'NO', which is a file with a FIXED size -- already safe. An
# uncapped autoextensible file reports the architectural sentinel
# 35184372064256 (32 TB), and reports the same value for a smallfile and a
# bigfile tablespace, so there is no smallfile branch to write. Comparing against
# the 12 GB limit instead of against the sentinel keeps working if Oracle ever
# changes it: a ceiling above the whole-database limit is not a ceiling.
#
# target_mb is the ceiling policy. SYSTEM and SYSAUX resolve to null, which means
# "never give this one a ceiling".
#
# want_mb is the ceiling the file is supposed to end up with. It is never below
# the current size of the file, because a ceiling under the current size is
# rejected and would be pointless.
#
# pending = 'Y' marks a file whose ceiling is HIGHER than want_mb, which covers
# both cases that matter: no ceiling at all (the 32 TB sentinel is higher than
# anything), and a ceiling left too high after the file became smaller. A ceiling
# that is already at or below want_mb is never touched, so a tighter limit that
# somebody set by hand is never raised.
