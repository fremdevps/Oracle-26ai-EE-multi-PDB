# desc: Shrink tablespaces and datafiles to reclaim unused space

# The AUDIT_TRAIL datafile grows to several GB and never shrinks back. The cost is
# structural, not a burst of activity: AUD$UNIFIED is interval-partitioned by DAY
# and every partition segment takes an 8 MB initial extent, so one day costs
# 1 table partition + 4 LOB partitions = ~41 MB almost regardless of how many
# records that day produced. Measured: 41 partitions holding 1716 rows used
# 1693 MB. Two independent levers reclaim that space:
#   1. Purge old audit records (drops whole partitions; optional, below).
#   2. Shrink the tablespace (compacts segments + resizes the datafile down).
#
# dbms_space.shrink_tablespace can relocate the internal AUD$UNIFIED partitions
# that ALTER TABLE / DROP TABLESPACE cannot touch from inside a PDB (those raise
# ORA-65040), so a plain shrink is the reliable, non-destructive fix.

# Optional Tier 1: purge audit records.
#
# What frees space here is dropping whole partitions, which clean_audit_trail does
# when every row in a partition predates the last archive timestamp. Deleting rows
# reclaims almost nothing on its own, because the freed SecureFile LOB space stays
# inside its segment.
#
# Since 26.4, after-first-db-start.sh installs a UC_AUDIT_PURGE scheduler job that
# does this nightly on a rolling 7-day window, so on a current install there is
# usually little left to purge. Databases created before that never purged at all
# (the old code only marked records archivable and never called
# clean_audit_trail), so the first run here can free gigabytes.
#
# Each type is purged in its own block with an exception handler so a type with
# nothing to purge does not abort the rest. Note the unified trail needs no
# cleanup initialisation: dbms_audit_mgmt.init_cleanup carries pragma deprecate,
# and is_cleanup_initialized raises ORA-46259 for UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL.

# Tier 2: drop the leftover old APEX engine schema (destructive, confirm-gated).
# An APEX upgrade (apexins.sql, see upgrade-apex.sh) installs the new version in
# a fresh APEX_<version> schema and leaves the prior one behind (e.g. APEX_240200
# alongside the live APEX_260100), wasting ~hundreds of MB in TBS_APEX. The public
# synonyms / apex_release already point only at the current schema, so the old one
# is dead weight. apxremov.sql is NOT used here: it removes the entire/current APEX.
# The supported way to remove just a prior version is DROP USER <old> CASCADE.
#
# APEX schemas are flagged oracle_maintained='Y', so a plain DROP USER raises
# ORA-28014 ("cannot drop administrative user or role") even as SYS. Setting
# "_oracle_script"=true for the session lifts that guard (this is how APEX's own
# removal scripts drop their schemas); it affects only this session.
#
# "Current" schema = the APEX_UTIL synonym owner (same lookup upgrade-apex.sh uses).
# The sentinel '###' prefix lets us strip the SQLcl banner from the captured output.

# Tier 3: reclaim space (non-destructive), in three steps:
#   1. SHRINK SPACE the FLOWS_FILES LOB to release dead space into the tablespace.
#   2. dbms_space.shrink_tablespace to compact segments.
#   (steps 1-2 share one connection)
#   3. In a fresh connection, resize each datafile down to its high-water mark --
#      the step that actually returns space to the OS (shrink_tablespace alone
#      usually can't trim the file). See the note above that block for why the
#      separate connection is required.
# AUDIT_TRAIL is included alongside the TBS_%/UNDOTBS% tablespaces. We first
# SHRINK SPACE the FLOWS_FILES file-repository
# LOB: it is a SECUREFILE LOB whose dead space (deleted/replaced app imports &
# uploads) is trapped *inside* the segment, so shrink_tablespace alone cannot
# reclaim it. Shrinking the LOB releases that space back into TBS_APEX first, then
# the tablespace shrink resizes the datafile down. LOB shrink is online and
# non-destructive (it compacts, never deletes live content).

# The resize MUST run in a SEPARATE connection from the shrink_tablespace block

# resize to 100 MB below the current size failed). A fresh connection sees the
# settled high-water mark, and the resize then succeeds.
