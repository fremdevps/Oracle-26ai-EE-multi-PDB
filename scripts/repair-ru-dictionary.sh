# desc: Find and repair a data dictionary left behind by a 26ai container image RU swap
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
# ============================================================================
#
# The Oracle Free 26ai image ships a PREBUILT database. When the container
# starts on an empty volume it copies that prebuilt database into
# /opt/oracle/oradata. When it starts on a volume that already holds a
# database, it only relinks the configuration files and opens what is there.
# It never upgrades anything -- there is no upgrade code in the entrypoint at
# all (grep for "upgrad" in /opt/oracle/*.sh returns nothing).
#
# So if you keep your oradata volume and change the image tag from, for
# example, 23.26.0.0 to 23.26.2.0, you get:
#
#   * 23.26.2 binaries
#   * a 23.26.0 data dictionary
#
# The container reports healthy. There is NO error. Every table, index,
# package and row stays valid. The only trace is dba_registry_history, which
# keeps the RU that created the volume.
#
# What you actually lose is every dictionary object that a skipped RU added.
# Measured on a real 23.26.0 -> 23.26.2 swap:
#
#   * All 9 assertion views (DBA_ASSERTIONS and relatives), added in 23.26.1.
#     The 6 ASSERT*$ base tables were already present, so `grant create
#     assertion` even succeeds -- the privilege is compiled into the binary --
#     but `select * from dba_assertions` raises ORA-00942.
#   * All 9 Deep Data Security / end-user-context views, added in 23.26.2.
#   * The in-database JVM. Any Java call raises
#       ORA-29548: ... could not find classes.bin version that matches
#                  executable version
#     while dba_registry still reports JAVAVM VALID. The status flag is stale.
#     Test it with: select dbms_java.longname('TEST') from dual;
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THE SUPPORTED TOOLS DO NOT HELP
# ============================================================================
#
# Both official paths were tried on a real reproduction and both refuse:
#
#   datapatch -verbose
#     Prints the mismatch it found:
#       Binary registry: 23.26.2.0.0 Release_Update 260428181725: Installed
#       PDB CDB$ROOT:    Applied 23.26.0.0.0 Release_Update 260428181725
#     then concludes "No release update patches need to be installed". It
#     matches on the RU patch ID, which is identical in both, and ignores the
#     differing version string. The Free image carries no OPatch inventory
#     entry ("There are no Interim patches installed in this Oracle Home"), so
#     there is nothing for it to act on.
#
#     WARNING: datapatch is worse than useless here. Its "bootstrapping
#     registry" step REWRITES dba_registry_history to the new RU while applying
#     zero dictionary changes. That destroys the only evidence of the problem.
#     Always record dba_registry_history BEFORE running datapatch. This script
#     prints it first for that reason.
#
#   catctl.pl catupgrd.sql  (and AutoUpgrade, which uses the same check)
#     Exits in about 2 seconds with:
#       PDB$SEED Open Mode = [MIGRATE] NO UPGRADE WILL BE PERFORMED
#       Container Database is already at current version.
#       ** Must upgrade either a CDB$ROOT or a Pdb **
#     It compares "23.0.0.0.0" against "23.0.0.0.0". The RU digits (26.0 versus
#     26.2) never enter the comparison.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT DOES WORK -- AND THE ORDER MATTERS
# ============================================================================
#
# Oracle ships the pieces; nothing drives them. Each feature added by an RU has
# up to three parts, and running only some of them leaves the database worse
# than before:
#
#   1. backport_files/bug_<n>_apply.sql
#      Creates or alters the base tables, inserts the SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP /
#      TABLE_PRIVILEGE_MAP / STMT_AUDIT_OPTION_MAP rows, and records itself in
#      sys.registry$backports. Its own header says "It is run by datapatch to
#      apply the patch to existing databases" -- which is exactly the thing
#      that does not happen here. SQL_STARTUP_MODE is NORMAL, so no UPGRADE
#      mode is needed.
#
#   2. The view script -- catassertion.sql, rxsviews.sql, and so on.
#      Pure CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW plus public synonyms, so it is idempotent.
#
#   3. The matching prvt*.plb package bodies.
#      THIS IS THE STEP THAT IS EASY TO MISS. Step 1 changes a base table's
#      column list, but the package bodies still in the dictionary were
#      compiled by the OLD RU and still insert the old column count. Skipping
#      step 3 leaves SYS.XS_DATA_SECURITY_INT and SYS.XS_SECURITY_CLASS_INT
#      INVALID with ORA-00947: not enough values, and marks the whole CATPROC
#      component INVALID. This script therefore runs a heal loop: recompile,
#      look for invalid SYS package bodies, reload the .plb that defines each
#      one, recompile again.
#
#   4. The JVM, separately: javavm/install/update_javavm_db.sql.
#      initjvm.sql refuses with ORA-29539 (Java system classes already
#      installed), so it is the wrong tool. update_javavm_db.sql is the
#      patch-time script and it works.
#
#   5. dbms_registry_sys.validate_components in every container, to clear the
#      stale JAVAVM VALID/INVALID flag once the JVM actually works.
#
# Everything is driven through catcon.pl so it reaches CDB$ROOT, PDB$SEED and
# every PDB. --force_pdb_mode "READ WRITE" is required to touch PDB$SEED.
# Note: --force_pdb_mode and -m are mutually exclusive; passing both fails with
# "at most one of --pdb_seed_mode and --force_open_mode may be specified".
#
# ============================================================================
# THE LIMIT OF THIS APPROACH -- READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING IT
# ============================================================================
#
# There are 383 *_apply.sql scripts in backport_files and NOTHING tells you
# which ones correspond to the RUs you skipped. This script works from a
# curated list of view names published in the 26ai "Changes in This Release"
# reference, resolves each missing view back to its defining script, and repairs
# those. That covers the dictionary surface you can name. It CANNOT prove that
# nothing else is missing -- fixed tables, PL/SQL behaviour changes and
# optimizer metadata are not visible this way.
#
# Treat this as a rescue tool for an environment you cannot rebuild. The
# reliable answer is: do not carry an oradata volume across RU versions.
# Create a fresh volume on the new image and move data with Data Pump.
#
# ============================================================================
# AFTER RUNNING THIS ON A REAL DATABASE: CHECK YOUR OWN SCHEMAS
# ============================================================================
#
# Reloading catalog scripts invalidates dependents, and the utlrp pass then
# recompiles them in parallel. Package bodies that call a SQL MACRO can fail
# that parallel recompile with a misleading error:
#
#   PL/SQL: ORA-62565: The SQL Macro method failed with error(s).
#   PLS-00201: identifier 'SOME_MACRO_FN' must be declared
#
# even though the macro function itself is present and VALID. It is a
# recompile-ordering artifact, not damage. A serial, single-object recompile
# fixes it every time:
#
#   alter package "OWNER"."PKG_NAME" compile body;
#
# Observed on a real dev database: 62 invalid objects before, 22 after (the
# repair fixed 41, including 7 invalid SYS audit objects), with 3 user package
# bodies newly invalid purely from this effect -- all 3 compiled cleanly on a
# single retry. So: compare the invalid-object list before and after, and
# serially recompile anything that newly appears. This script deliberately does
# NOT auto-recompile application schemas; that is your code, not the dictionary.
#
# ============================================================================
# HOW TO VALIDATE THAT THIS STILL WORKS ON A FUTURE RU
# ============================================================================
#
# The regression test that produced all of the above is reproducible on any
# throwaway Docker host with about 25 GB free:
#
#   1. docker volume create ru-test
#      docker run -d --name ru-test -e ORACLE_PWD=... \
#        -v ru-test:/opt/oracle/oradata --shm-size=2g \
#        container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:<OLD_RU>
#      Wait for "DATABASE IS READY TO USE" in the logs.
#
#   2. Create some objects and data, and record a fingerprint
#      (row counts and sums) so you can prove nothing was lost.
#
#   3. docker stop -t 300 ru-test && docker rm ru-test
#      Start the SAME volume on free:<NEW_RU>. Both tags must use the same
#      ORACLE_HOME path or the relinked config files break -- check with
#      `docker run --rm --entrypoint bash <image> -c 'ls -d /opt/oracle/product/*/dbhomeFree'`.
#
#   4. Run this script with --check. It must report the RU mismatch, the
#      missing views and the broken JVM. If it reports a clean database, either
#      Oracle fixed the image or the curated view list needs the new RU's
#      views added (see NEW_VIEWS_* below).
#
#   5. Run with --repair, then --check again. Everything must come back clean
#      and the data fingerprint must be unchanged.
#
#   6. As a control, start a FRESH volume on free:<NEW_RU> and run --check
#      against it. It must be clean. That is what proves a finding is caused by
#      the swap and not by the image itself.
#
# When a new RU ships, add its new view names to NEW_VIEWS_<RU> from
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/refrn/changes-this-release-oracle-database-reference.html

# so the DBA_HIST_* probes above already cover them.
#
# CHECK EVERY CANDIDATE AGAINST A FRESH DATABASE OF THE NEW RU BEFORE YOU ADD
# IT. The home defining a view does not mean a Free install ever creates it.
# The 23.26.3 diff also reports ALL/DBA/USER_CATALOG_PROVIDERS, and adding them
# looked right -- but a fresh 23.26.3 database has neither those views nor the
# C##ADP$SERVICE user that owns them, because Free does not install Data Studio.
# They are a false positive: the probe reports "MISSING - repairable" forever,
# and dbms_catalog_install.sql cannot fix it (ORA-00942 on
# C##ADP$SERVICE.DBA_CATALOG_PROVIDERS). Its real driver,
# data_studio_install.sql, would install the whole Data Studio stack that Free
# deliberately leaves out. So: if the control database does not have the view,
# it does not belong in this list.

  --check                Diagnose only. Read-only. This is the default.
  --summary              Read-only, machine-readable "key=value" lines only.
                         Built for CI: assert with `grep -qx 'jvm_ok=yes'` and
                         friends, the same style as .github/fixtures/upgrade.
  --repair               Apply the repairs. Needs the SYS password.
  --container NAME       Database container. Defaults to $CONTAINER_NAME from .env.
  --password PW          SYS password. Defaults to $ORACLE_PWD from .env.
                         Only needed for --repair (catcon.pl cannot use OS auth
                         reliably; plain sqlplus calls use "/ as sysdba").
  --views "A,B,C"        Extra view names to probe, on top of the curated list.
  -y, --yes              Do not ask for confirmation before repairing.

# It marks EVERY component INVALID and then revalidates them all. On a real
# install that includes APEX that left APEX INVALID in dba_registry even though
# all 4492 APEX objects were VALID and `validate_apex` run on its own succeeds
# and restores VALID. A self-inflicted regression: the dictionary repair would
# "succeed" while reporting APEX as broken.
#
# So: only touch components that are ALREADY INVALID, and revalidate each by
# calling the procedure the registry itself nominates
# (dba_registry.procedure -- INITJVMAUX.VALIDATE_JAVAVM for JAVAVM,
# VALIDATE_APEX for APEX). Anything already VALID is left alone.
#
# This runs even when steps 1-3 find nothing to do, because a stale component
# flag is its own repairable condition: update_javavm_db.sql leaves JAVAVM
# INVALID with a perfectly working JVM, and nothing else clears it.
# Each component is validated in its OWN session, and retried once.
#
# The validation procedures recompile their own packages. Calling two of them in
# one session means the second one runs against package state that the first one
# just invalidated, and it dies with ORA-04061 "existing state of ... has been
# invalidated". Worse, VALIDATE_APEX catches that internally, reports
# "ORA-20001: ORA-04061 ..." and then sets the APEX registry flag to INVALID.
#
# That is a self-inflicted regression, and it only appears on an install that
# has APEX: JAVAVM is revalidated first, APEX second, so APEX always loses.
# Seen on the 23.26.2 -> 23.26.3 CI gate, which went from
# non_valid_components=0 before the repair to 1 after it, with all 4492 APEX
