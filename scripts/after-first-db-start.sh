# The unified audit table is interval-partitioned by DAY, and Oracle's default
# _partition_large_extents=TRUE gives every partition segment an 8 MB initial
# extent. One day of auditing therefore costs 1 table partition + 4 LOB
# partitions (SQL_TEXT, SQL_BINDS, RLS_INFO, DP_CLOB_PARAMETERS) = ~41 MB,
# almost regardless of how many audit records that day produced. Measured on a
# real install: 41 partitions holding 1716 rows occupied 1693 MB.
#
# So audit_trail needs both a ceiling and the purge job further down. Its
# increment is 8m to match the extent size -- with next 2m every new LOB
# partition forces four separate extends.

-- records archivable but had no purge behind it and so never freed a byte.
--
-- dbms_audit_mgmt.create_purge_job is deliberately NOT used: it cannot advance
-- the last archive timestamp, so use_last_arch_timestamp=>TRUE purges up to a
-- frozen point forever and FALSE wipes the whole trail on every run. Neither
-- gives a rolling window. One scheduler job doing both calls does.
--
-- dbms_audit_mgmt.init_cleanup is NOT used either. It carries pragma deprecate

-- UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL". The unified trail needs no cleanup initialisation.

-- space stays inside its segment. The freed space returns to the tablespace,
-- not to the operating system; shrink-space does that part.

-- because ORA-12954 is raised before the open. "open read only" and
-- "open upgrade" fail identically, and nothing inside the PDB can be changed to
-- repair it.
--
-- 900 is the Oracle default. Set it explicitly so the intent is recorded and a

-- autotuner to grow the datafile harder, which is the failure being prevented.
