# Enable Advanced Compression for a single app schema's tablespace and apply it
# to that schema's existing objects.
#
# create-user.sh gives every app user its own bigfile-free tablespace named
# tbs_<username>. This script:
#   1. Sets that tablespace's DEFAULTs so *new* segments are created compressed:
#        - tables: COMPRESS FOR OLTP   (advanced row compression; recompresses on DML)
#        - indexes: COMPRESS ADVANCED LOW (per-block prefix dedup, ~no read overhead)
#   2. Rebuilds the schema's *existing* tables (MOVE) and indexes (REBUILD) so the
#      data already in the tablespace is compressed too -- setting the default
#      alone never touches segments that already exist.
#
# Everything runs through the SYS connection ($DB_CONN_NAME): ALTER TABLESPACE
# needs the ALTER TABLESPACE privilege the app user doesn't have, and SYS can
# MOVE/REBUILD the schema's objects by owner-qualified name.
#
# MOVE/REBUILD are ONLINE and non-destructive (they rebuild a segment, never drop
# data) and idempotent (already-advanced-compressed objects are skipped), so this
# is safe to re-run. Per-object exception handling means an object that can't be
# moved (partitioned, IOT, a feature MOVE ONLINE rejects, ...) is reported and
# skipped without aborting the rest.
#
# Advanced Compression is included in Oracle Database Free, so there is no licence
# concern here.
#
# After rebuilding, the freed extents sit inside the tablespace -- the datafile on
# disk is still its old size. So this script then reclaims that space, reusing the
# proven shrink-space.sh recipe scoped to this one tablespace:
#   - dbms_space.shrink_tablespace compacts the segments, then
#   - in a SEPARATE connection, the datafile is resized down to its high-water
#     mark (the step that returns space to the OS). The separate connection is
#     mandatory: shrink_tablespace leaves transient blocks high in the file for
#     the rest of that session, so a same-session resize hits ORA-03297 and frees
#     nothing. See the matching note in shrink-space.sh.
